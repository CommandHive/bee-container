│  You are operating in "full plan" mode, where you generate a complete plan   │

│  Steps are sequential, but each Step can have parallel subtasks.             │
│  For each Step, specify a description of the step and independent subtasks   │

│      1. Clear description of the task that an LLM can execute                │

│  1. The objective has been achieved in full or substantively                 │
│  2. The remaining work is minor or trivial compared to what's been           │

│  Be decisive - avoid excessive planning steps that add little value. It's    │
